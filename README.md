Habit Tracker with Pixela & GitHub Actions

Turn your GitHub contributions into a colorful habit graph on Pixela—automatically! Every time you push code (or at a scheduled time), GitHub Actions fires up a Python script (main.py) that pulls your daily activity and posts it to your Pixela API graph.

⸻

🚀 Features
	•	Automatic tracking: No more manual scripts—runs on every push to main and nightly.
	•	GitHub GraphQL: Fetches your true daily contributions (commits, issues, PRs) via GitHub’s GraphQL API.
	•	Pixela API: Uses Pixela’s simple REST endpoints to record and visualize your habit data.
	•	Customizable: Tweak triggers, schedule, or the data you post in just a few lines of YAML.

⸻

📋 Prerequisites
	•	Pixela account with a graph created. (https://pixe.la/#/)
	•	GitHub repo for your code.
	•	GitHub token with minimum scopes (read:user, repo) or use the built-in GITHUB_TOKEN.
	•	Python 3.x and the requests library.

main.py breakdown:
	1.	Authenticate with GitHub & Pixela using environment variables.
	2.	Query GitHub GraphQL API for today’s total contributions.
	3.	POST that number to your Pixela graph endpoint.

⸻

🎯 Setup
	1.	Clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo


	2.	Add your secrets in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
	•	PIXELA_TOKEN (your Pixela API token)
	•	GH_PAT (your GitHub Personal Access Token) or rely on ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
	3.	Install Python deps:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requests



⸻

🎒 Usage
	•	Local run (for testing):

export PIXELA_TOKEN="<your-pixela-token>"
export GH_PAT="<your-pat>"          # if used
python main.py


	•	View your graph:
Visit https://pixe.la/v1/users/<username>/graphs/<graph-id>.html in a browser.

⚙️ GitHub Actions Workflow

Located at .github/workflows/pixela.yml, this file defines:
	•	Triggers: push on main & daily cron at 23:59 UTC.
	•	Jobs: checkout, setup Python, install deps, run main.py.

name: Update Habit Tracker

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: "59 23 * * *"

jobs:
  track:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - run: pip install requests
      - run: python main.py
        env:
          PIXELA_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PIXELA_TOKEN }}
          GH_PAT:        ${{ secrets.GH_PAT }}  # or GITHUB_TOKEN

Workflow in Action

Your workflow dashboard: green checks mean success!

⸻

🔧 Customization Tips
	•	Events: Add pull_request, issues, or manual workflow_dispatch under on:.
	•	Schedule: Change the cron for a different time (see Crontab guru).
	•	Data logic: Modify main.py to post only commits, or sum lines changed, etc.

⸻

🐞 Troubleshooting
	1.	No workflow run? Ensure pixela.yml is on main branch and indentation is correct.
	2.	Authentication errors? Re-check secret names and values.
	3.	Script failures? Inspect logs under Actions → Update Habit Tracker → Runs.

📖 Pixela API Overview

Pixela is a lightweight habit-tracking service. You:
	1.	Create a user: POST /v1/users
	2.	Define a graph: POST /v1/users/<user>/graphs
	3.	Add a pixel: POST /v1/users/<user>/graphs/<graph-id> with { date, quantity }

Our main.py handles step (3), using your existing graph to mark daily progress. Learn more at Pixela Docs.
